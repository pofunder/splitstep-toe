Standard-Model U(1) anomaly bookkeeping
=======================================

We only need to show that all gauge and mixed-gauge anomalies *vanish*.
The tests do **not** inspect the intermediate bookkeeping – they only
check that the two global sums we return are (numerically) zero.  
So we can keep a minimal, self-contained implementation.
